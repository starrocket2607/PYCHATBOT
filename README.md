# PYCHATBOT

The ChatBot is built using NLTK which is a Natural Language Toolkit in python. It is a rule based chatbot that replies to simple questions like: ”What is your name?”, “Tell me a joke”, “Tell me a fact”. It is able to reply to simple questions by the user. 


We built the GUI using Tkinter library of Python. The Planet Recognition system consists of a pertained ResNet50 Model with its last layer replaced by a softmax unit of 10 units. The model is Built using the Keras library. The weights of the ResNet50 are set to non-trainable while the the weights of the softmax unit are trained using a small image dataset of planets downloaded from google images. 


The neural Network, is the machine learing algorithm to identify the planetary object which the user submits.
The PY_CHATBOT_andIDENTIFIER.py contains the code for the GUI of the planet Identifier and Chatbot
